# React lessons

This directory contains all the slides and exercises from the 2017 ZIntern
advanced JavaScript/React class. This class was intended to be highly interactive,
consisting of about a half hour to forty-five minutes of improvised lecture based
on the first 9 slides, followed by an hour of hands-on, follow-along coding to the
assignments on 10â€“16 (as time permits). There is also a reasonably lengthy reading
list.

This material was developed using Gatsby, a static site generator that uses React
for rendering. The GraphQL assignment uses the graph.cool service.

## Setup

Install all required dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the gatsby server, run:

```
npm run develop
```

The slides can then be accessed at http://localhost:8000/slides/,
the assignments at http://localhost:8000/assignemnts/ and the
reading list at http://localhost:8000/notes/
